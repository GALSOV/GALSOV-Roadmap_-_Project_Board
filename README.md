# GALSOV — Public Roadmap & Project Board

GALSOV (Galactic Sovereignty) is a deterministic, turn-based 4X space strategy game being built as a learn-by-building public experiment.

This repository is **roadmap-only**:
- ✅ Roadmap / milestones / Kanban board
- ✅ Design notes that are safe to share
- ✅ Devlog links, screenshots, progress updates
- ❌ No engine source code
- ❌ No production game assets
- ❌ No build pipeline secrets / keys / internal tooling

## Where is the code?
The engine repository is currently **private** while v0.1 is being implemented for commercial release.

## Current status
- Milestone: v0.1 (MVP engine + minimal UI hooks)
- Determinism-first: same seed → same galaxy → same TurnTrace

## Roadmap / Project Board

## How to follow / get involved
- Use **Issues** for: feature requests, discussion, and (later) bugs found in public builds.
